# Puerta App: Realestate Map 
*by **Scottie Schneider, Rob Allen, Pedro Prieto, Sebastian Garces, Vital "Frenchy" Boisset, Nedu Robert, Lesley Banadzem,  ***


# Project Overview

In this hackathon project, The team was tasked to develop a progressive web application featuring a map with locations of real estate listings.

People want EVERYTHING on demand, and why not? Seeing a house you'd like to buy shouldn't be any different. Our mission, should you choose to join us, is to create an Uber-like for real estate.

Someone interested in buying a home opens the app, seeing a spread of icons of homes available. They click on a home, schedule a time to see the house, and are matched with a real estate agent who will pick them up or meet them on location.

I then had to add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, and various ways to browse the content.

## A11y

 - Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab
   through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or
   interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.
 - Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those
   elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate
   `ARIA roles`  are defined.
 - All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that
   clearly describes the content of the image.
